# README for Analysis of Email Phishing Attacks Using Deep Neural Networks

## Overview

This project aims to analyze email phishing attacks using Deep Neural Networks. 
We provide a Google Colab notebook containing the code for this analysis. 
In this README, we'll guide you on how to run the Colab notebook and provide steps to download the dataset.

## Getting Started

To run the project, you will need access to Google Colab and the dataset. Here's how you can get started:

1. Download the Dataset

	1.1 Download all the enron.tar files on your local machine
		You can use the following link to access the dataset: http://nlp.cs.aueb.gr/software_and_datasets/Enron-Spam/index.html
		We have used the .tar files of Enron-Spam in pre-processed form. There are total 6 .tar files. <br>
	1.2  Open the following .ipynb file on google colab <br>
		Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Vt71pnfdT977fJWKiXc4ChpJW8GWeOLc?usp=sharing
	1.3 Upload the 6 enron.tar files to google colab. <br>
	1.4 Run each cell one after the other on colab and you will receive a email_dataset.csv file <br>
	1.5 Make sure to download this dataset to your local machine. <br>

	OR

	1.1 You can download the already unzipped, and merged dataset from our drive link:
		Link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1BXxLuwul-oxK2A0ujezi-KhEPGbwgv-L/view

2. Spam Detection Google Colab
	2.1 Go to Google Colab and sign in to your Google account if you're not already logged in. <br>
	2.2 Open the following .ipynb file on google colab  <br>
		Link: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1t3nhLppJ-1VsrjFRUYiv7SjSjzUo8YBd#scrollTo=cJm0O8NngHck <br>
	2.3 Once you have opened the notebook uplaod your downloaded email_dataset.csv to the notebook <br>
	2.4 Now that you have the dataset in your Colab workspace, you can run the notebook. Here's how to do it: <br>
		Run all the cells by clicking "Runtime" in the top menu and selecting "Run All." <br>

3. Monitor the Execution
The notebook will start running the code. You can monitor the execution in real-time and observe the results.

4. Interact with the Results
Once the code execution is complete, you can interact with the results, review visualizations, and explore the analysis.
